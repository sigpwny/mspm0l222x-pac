# The CTR_WIDTH field in the AESADV_CTRL register has different uses depending
# on whether the CTR or CFB fields are set. The SVD file does not handle all
# of the cases for CFB mode and also added duplicate enumerated values.
# This is resolved by combining the CTR_WIDTH enumerated value definitions.
#
# The OFB_GCM_CCM_CONT field also has a dual use depending on whether
# OFB mode or CCM/GCM mode is selected.

          This bit has a dual use, depending on the selection of CCM/GCM, see bits [18:16].
          If CCM/GCM is not selected:
          If this bit is set to 1b, full block AES output feedback mode (OFB-128) is selected.
          If CCM/GCM is selected:
          Continue processing of an interrupted AES-GCM or AES-CCM operation in the AAD phase.
          Set this write-only signal to 1b together with the regular mode bit settings for a GCM or CCM operation, to continue processing from the next full AAD block (128 bits) boundary.
          Before setting this bit all applicable context to resume processing must have been loaded into the engine: Keys, IV, intermediate digest/TAG, block counter and the CCM align data word (the latter is for CCM mode only). The mode can be written together with this bit, as it is part of the same register.
